Current Setup
You now have a project directory called rainbow that has a .git directory inside it, and you also have one file, called rainbowcolors.txt, in your working directory.
The staging area and commit history are empty because you have not yet made any commits in the rainbow repository.
This can all be seen in Visualize It 3-1.
